Brioche is a Python library for performing a biomization analysis of pollen samples.

It implements the protocol defined by Prentice et al. (1996), using Pandas for efficient analysis of a large number of pollen samples across time or sites. It was implemented to support a study of eastern African mountain evolution by Githumbi et al. (submitted).

Brioche is best used in a Jupyter notebook, but the library also includes a command line tool.

# Method

To use Brioche you need to define a set of plant functional types (PFTs). As defined by Prentice et al., PFTs are "broad classes of plant defined by stature (e.g. tree/shrub), leaf form (e.g. broad-leaved/needle-leaved), phenology (e.g. evergreen/deciduous), and climatic adaptations". In brioche each PFT is identified by a number:

TODO: example table.

Next you need to define a **biome x PFT matrix** that maps your set of biomes to the PFTs that are dominant in each one.  Working with a full matrix can be unwieldy, so brioche supports reading a simple table with one row for each biome, followed by a list of the PFTs that map to it:

| Biome | PFTs |
|-------|------|
| Grassland/afroalpine | 12 |
| Ericaceous scrub | 17 9 14 12 |
| Moorland | 13 14 15 |	

Finally the taxa in the samples must be mapped to one or more PFTs in a **taxa x PFT matrix**. (Prentice uses a *PFT x taxon matrix* instead, but the transposed structure is easier to work with since there's typically many more taxa than PFTs.) This is also most conveniently represented as a table with one row for each taxon, followed by a list of the PFTs that it maps to:

| Taxa | PFTs |
|------|------|
| Abrus | 7 10 |
| Abutilon | 1 7 |
| Acacia | 2 4 6 7 |
| Acalypha | 10 11 |	

Brioche combines the two mappings to create a **taxon x biome matrix** (again, Prentice uses a *biome x taxon matrix*), where each cell holds a 1 or a 0 to indicate if the taxon maps to that biome.  This matrix is only used during the calculation, but can be output to verify the mapping.

TODO: reading samples, producing output
